<div class="faq-container">
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">When are auditions?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">We generally hold auditions on the first or second weekend of both the Fall and Spring semesters. </div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">Who can audition?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">Any college student in the greater Boston area! We rarely take graduate students, but as long as you're enrolled in a degree program and are able to make it to rehearsals on Northeastern's campus you're welcome to try out.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">What should I prepare for the audition?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        We ask that you prepare a short solo between 60-90 seconds of a verse and a chorus from a song.
        Please try and pick a song that showcases your voice in the genre of music that we sing (pop, indie, etc.).<br><br>
        We ask that you do NOT sing any musical theater or opera pieces, or any other style very different from our style - check out our Spotify/YouTube to listen to our music!<br><br>

        In addition to your solo, we may ask you to do some vocal exercises, or potentially a second song, if we feel we don't yet have a good sense for your voice.
        If you are auditioning for VP, we ask you to prepare a set that showcases your entire kit.<br><br>

        We do NOT allow any background track or instruments to be played while you sing -- it must be completely a cappella!
    </div>
</div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">Do I need to sign up?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">No, but it helps us out! We'll post signup links on our <a href="https://instagram.com/distilledharmonynu">Instagram</a> a few days before auditions, so you can make sure you get a slot at the time that suits you best. That being said, walk-ins are always welcome!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">Is it hard to get in?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">Our group usually has around 12-16 members, so auditions are definitely competitive, but we encourage everyone to audition! </div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">Can I audition more than once?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">Of course! The needs of the group are always changing, so you never know what weâ€™re looking for in a particular semester. Many of our current group members didn't get in on their first try! </div>
