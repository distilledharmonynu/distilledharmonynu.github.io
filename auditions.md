# Auditions FAQs

### When are auditions?
We generally hold auditions on the first or second weekend of both the Fall and Spring semesters. 

### Who can audition?
Any college student in the greater Boston area! We rarely take graduate students, but as long as you're enrolled in a degree program and are able to make it to rehearsals on Northeastern's campus you're welcome to try out.

### What should I prepare for the audition?
We ask that you prepare a short solo between 60-90 seconds of a verse and a chorus from a song. Please try and pick a song that showcases your voice in the genre of music that we sing (pop, indie, etc.) We ask that you do NOT sing any musical theater or opera pieces, or any other style very different from our style - check out our Spotify/Youtube to listen to our music!

In addition to your solo, we may ask you to do some vocal exercises, or potentially a second song, if we feel we don't yet have a good sense for your voice. If you are auditioning for VP we ask you to prepare a set that showcases your entire kit.

We do NOT allow any background track or instruments to be played while you sing -- it must be completely a cappella!

### Do I need to sign up?
No, but it helps us out! We'll post signup links on our <a href="https://instagram.com/distilledharmonynu">Instagram</a> a few days before auditions, so you can make sure you get a slot at the time that suits you best. That being said, walk-ins are always welcome!

### Is it hard to get in?
Our group usually has around 12-16 members, so auditions are definitely competitive, but we encourage everyone to audition! 

### Can I audition more than once?
Of course! The needs of the group are always changing, so you never know what weâ€™re looking for in a particular semester. Many of our current group members didn't get in on their first try!
