### About Us

Distilled Harmony is one of the many collegiate a cappella groups in the Boston area, and one of three all-gender a cappella groups at Northeastern University. Founded in 2003, they are an energetic, creative, and dedicated group, performing music anywhere from Phoebe Bridgers to FLO. While they love to sing at Northeastern and around Boston, they have had the privilege of progressing to the quarter and semifinal ICCA competitions and are attending the National A Cappella Convention in Orlando, Florida this April! 

This year, DH recently released the first two songs from their live performance video series, which were “Pink Light” opb. MUNA and “Superpower” opb. Beyoncé and Frank Ocean! They also have a large catalog of studio projects, most recently their 2022 ICCA EP titled “Mirage” and a new single, “How Ya Doin’?” opb. Little Mix! Despite the hard work that each group member puts into the music, Distilled Harmony is a group full of heart and laughter, and we would love to share some of that heart through our music! To stay up to date on what DH is getting up to, follow them on all social media platforms @distilledharmonynu.
