### About Us

Distilled Harmony is one of the many collegiate a cappella groups in the Boston area, and one of three all-gender a cappella groups at Northeastern University. Founded in 2003, we are an energetic, creative, and dedicated group, performing music anywhere from Phoebe Bridgers to FLO. While we love to sing at Northeastern and around Boston, we have also had the privilege of progressing to the semifinal of ICCAs and attending the National A Cappella Convention in Orlando, Florida, and will be competing again in ICCAs this Spring!

Last year, we released three songs from our live performance video series: “Pink Light” opb. MUNA, “Superpower” opb. Beyoncé and Frank Ocean, and "Not My Job" opb. FLO. We also have a large catalog of studio projects, most recently our 2024 NACC EP titled "Ways I Fall"! Despite the hard work that each group member puts into the music, Distilled Harmony is a group full of heart and laughter, and we love to share that heart through our music. To stay up to date on what DH is getting up to, follow us below on all social media platforms @distilledharmonynu.
